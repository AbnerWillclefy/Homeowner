# The React PWA

Related: [ADR 0005](../adr/0005-ship-a-react-pwa-not-a-native-app.md), [ADR 0006](../adr/0006-localize-with-a-small-typed-module.md), [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-tailwind-and-radix-for-an-accessible-calm-ui.md). Terms: **Resident**, **Home** in [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md).

The PWA is one Vite app in `web/`, installed to the Home Screen. It has a precaching service worker and no runtime caching. A *PWA* (progressive web app) is a website that can be installed and work offline.

## Modules

| Folder | Status | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `src/i18n/` | Built | Language: which locale to show and every user-facing string for it. Detailed below. |
| `src/theme/` | Built | Appearance: System, Light or Dark, and applying it. Detailed under UI layer. |
| `src/settings/` | Built | The Settings section at the bottom of the home screen. |
| `src/auth/` | Built | Sign-up, confirmation, sign-in and token handling against Cognito. |
| `src/api/` | Built | The API client: `authedFetch` and the typed calls to `/me` and `/push/*`. |
| `src/push/` | Built | The reminders controls and Web Push subscription. |
| `src/sw.ts`, `src/sw/` | Built | The service worker: precache and push handling. |

Tests are vitest in a Node environment, on pure modules only (API client, token logic, formatting, `i18n`). There are no component tests, so screens are checked by hand ([ADR 0007](../adr/0007-tailwind-and-radix-for-an-accessible-calm-ui.md)).

## Localization

The supported languages are the closed set `en-US` and `pt-BR`. Components import only from `src/i18n/index.ts` and never from a catalog.

```

- `locales.ts`, `resolveLocale.ts` and `translate.ts` are pure: no React, no DOM, no catalog imports. The service worker build can share them.
- `resolveLocale` picks a valid stored choice, else the first `navigator.languages` entry that is Portuguese (`pt-BR`) or English (`en-US`), else `en-US`.
- `translate` looks a key up in the locale's catalog, falls back per key to `en-US`, fills `{name}` placeholders and picks plural forms with `Intl.PluralRules`.
- The catalogs are typed objects. `en-US` defines the keys; `pt-BR` must match them or the type check fails. A test checks matching placeholders and no empty values.
- Both catalogs are bundled in the main chunk, which is precached, so both languages work offline.
- `I18nProvider` keeps the locale in React context and sets `<html lang>` to it.
- The Reminders section and the iPhone install steps read from the catalogs. The sign-in screens are still English until #75 moves their strings into the catalogs. The Settings section's labels are in both catalogs.

## UI layer

Styling is Tailwind CSS v4, added through `@tailwindcss/vite` (no `tailwind.config.js`, no PostCSS). Decisions are in [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-tailwind-and-radix-for-an-accessible-calm-ui.md).

### Tokens

Colours are semantic tokens declared in `@theme` in `src/index.css`, with the light value there and the dark value in a plain `[data-theme="dark"]` override. Components use `bg-surface text-text`; there are no `dark:` variants. The default palette is removed (`--color-*: initial`), so a raw palette class compiles to nothing, and `src/theme/semanticClasses.test.ts` fails on one or on any `dark:` variant.

| Token | Used for |
|---|---|
| `surface`, `surface-raised` | Page background, and fields and buttons |
| `text`, `muted` | Body text, and secondary text such as hints |
| `accent`, `accent-contrast` | Primary buttons and links, and the label on an accent fill |
| `danger` | Reserved for problems; not used on screens yet |
| `focus` | The 2px focus ring |
| `border` | Field and button edges (3:1 against the surface) |

Measured contrast (WCAG ratios, computed from the hex values):

| Pair | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `text` on `surface` / `surface-raised` | 14.88 / 15.86 | 15.28 / 13.65 |
| `muted` on `surface` / `surface-raised` | 6.78 / 7.23 | 8.48 / 7.58 |
| `accent` on `surface` / `surface-raised` | 5.62 / 5.99 | 9.51 / 8.49 |
| `accent-contrast` on `accent` | 5.99 | 9.48 |
| `danger` on `surface` / `surface-raised` | 6.13 / 6.54 | 7.88 / 7.03 |
| `focus` on `surface` / `surface-raised` | 5.90 / 6.29 | 8.53 / 7.62 |
| `border` on `surface` / `surface-raised` | 4.23 / 4.51 | 5.19 / 4.63 |

Text needs 4.5, the focus ring and control edges need 3.

### Theme

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SCRIPT[inline script in index.html] -->|before first paint| HTML[html data-theme and theme-color]
    STORE[(localStorage homeowner.theme)] --> SCRIPT
    STORE --> PROV[ThemeProvider]
    MM[matchMedia prefers-color-scheme] --> SCRIPT
    MM -->|change events, only while System| PROV
    PROV -->|applyTheme| HTML
    SET[Settings appearance select] -->|setChoice| PROV
    PROV -->|writes| STORE
    LANG[language select, #50] -.-> SET

    classDef planned stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#666
    class LANG planned
```

- The stored value is `light` or `dark`; System is the absence of the key. Anything else stored is ignored and treated as System, and is left in place until the person chooses.
- The applied value is always a concrete `light` or `dark` on `<html data-theme>`, so the CSS has two states. `color-scheme` follows it, so native controls and autofill match.
- `theme.ts` (pure) holds `resolveTheme`. The inline script in `index.html` repeats that rule because it cannot import; `inlineScript.test.ts` runs the real script against fakes and checks it agrees. It never throws (private mode and blocked storage are caught).
- The script is a plain, synchronous `<script>` in `<head>`, so there is no flash of the wrong theme. The CloudFront response headers policy sets no Content-Security-Policy today. If one is added, this script needs a hash.
- `browserTheme.ts` is the only code touching `localStorage`, `document` and the status bar meta tag; `ThemeProvider` re-resolves on `matchMedia` changes while the choice is System, and on `storage` events from another tab. Switching theme changes an attribute only, so no screen remounts.
- `theme-color` follows the theme at runtime. The manifest's `theme_color` and `background_color` are static (the light surface), so launching in dark mode shows a brief light splash on Android.

### Settings

`src/settings/Settings.tsx` is the Settings section, the last child of the home screen, shown signed in or out. Each setting is one labelled row with a native control. Appearance is the first row, a native `<select>` showing the choice (never the applied value). The language selector (#50) adds a row with the same pattern.

### Type, layout and components

- System font stack, no web font. `html` uses `font: -apple-system-body` so `rem` follows iOS Dynamic Type, with a plain `font-size` and `font-family` for other browsers. All sizes are `rem`; tappable elements use a `2.75rem` minimum (44px at the default size) that grows with text.
- One column of `32rem`, with the safe-area insets kept on all four sides (the `page` utility).
- Buttons, links and fields are native elements styled with the `btn`, `btn-primary` and `btn-link` utilities and base rules in `index.css`. Buttons keep a border so they stay visible in forced-colors mode; a disabled button is dashed as well as muted.
- Radix Primitives (`@radix-ui/react-slot`) and `lucide-react` are installed for later screens but not imported yet: native elements cover everything on screen today.
- The service worker precaches the built CSS, and the theme is local only, so appearance works offline.

## Service worker

The worker shows a fallback notification when a push has no usable title (no payload, malformed JSON, or an empty title). Its text comes from `fallback.ts`, a record keyed by locale that lives outside the catalogs.

- The worker imports only `locales.ts`, `resolveLocale.ts`, `browserLanguages.ts` and `fallback.ts`, by path and never through the `src/i18n/index.ts` barrel, so neither catalog is bundled into `sw.js`. `tsconfig.sw.json` lists these files and uses the `WebWorker` lib with no DOM, so the type check fails if one of them starts to import React, the DOM or a catalog.
- The language is the device language: `self.navigator.languages` is read on every push and resolved by `resolveLocale` (a Portuguese tag gives `pt-BR`, anything else gives `en-US`). If reading it throws, the worker uses `en-US`. A notification is always shown.
- The in-app language choice is not read, because workers have no `localStorage`. A later ticket could mirror the choice into IndexedDB.
- A push with a valid title passes through exactly as sent, in any language. The server's text is never translated.
